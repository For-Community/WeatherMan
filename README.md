## How to make changes to the project
# 1. Fork this Repository.
To edit or commit changes to a project which you like, you need to fork that<br>
Forking is a process where the master repository will be created in your github profile.<br>
You can find the fork option here<br>

# 2. Clone the repository.
After forking, if you are willing to commit small text changes, then github edit is preferrable.<br>
If you want commit major changes or change the source code<br>
To do that, you need to clone the repository created on your profile locally.<br>
Here you can find the clone option<br>

Copy the link, open github CLI or any of your preferred CLI,<br>
Then type git clone ***link***

# 3. Create a branch.
This statement is self explanatory<br>
To create a branch locally, follow the following steps<br>

You can name it anything you want or the suggested one by the master<br>

# 4. Make necessary changes and commit those changes.

Make the necessary changes you are willing to and save them.<br>

# 5. Push those changes into github.

After making the necessary changes, you need to push them to the repository, using git commands<br>
You can check this gif, and follow along<br>

# 6. Create pull request.

All set, now you need to create a pull request to merge the changes you have made with the master branch<br>
You can follow this image for the guidelines to create a pull request<br>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
